This is a provisional file with the instructions on how to build the
TrackPropagation/Geant4e package. Special actions are needed due to
the fact that Geant4e is still not included in Geant4. For this reason
the geant4 version compiled in

/afs/cern.ch/cms/geant4rep/geant4_releases/geant4.7.1

should be used. The following steps must be taken:

1) Setup the CMSSW project

2) Checkout TrackPropagation/Geant4e and SimG4Core/Packaging

3) Setup the tool geant4e with scramv1:

[#] scramv1 setup -i geant4
...

when requested for the value of GEANT4_BASE, set it to:

     /afs/cern.ch/cms/geant4rep/geant4_releases/geant4.7.1/slc3_ia32_gcc323

when requested for the value of GEANT4_SHARE_LIB, set it to:

     /afs/cern.ch/cms/geant4rep/geant4_releases/geant4.7.1/share

4) Edit the file $CMSSW_BASE/.SCRAM/slc3_ia32_gcc323/ToolCache.db and
   add the G4error library to the list of Geant4 libraries, just after
   G4xrays. This has to be modified in a couple of places.

5) Edit $CMSSW_BASE/src/SimG4Core/Packaging/g4magic and replace

   G4SHARE=`scramv1 tool tag geant4 GEANT4_SHARE_BASE`

   with

   G4SHARE=/afs/cern.ch/cms/geant4rep/geant4_releases/geant4.7.1/share

6) Now you can build TrackPropagation/Geant4e!
